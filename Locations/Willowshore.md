# History

[Monks](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Monk "Monk") of [Sangpotshi](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sangpotshi "Sangpotshi") led by [Zhi Hui](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Zhi_Hui "Zhi Hui") founded the [Tan Sugi Monastery](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Tan_Sugi_Monastery "Tan Sugi Monastery") in [7020 IC](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/4520_AR "4520 AR") and founded Willowshore nearby, first to support its construction and then to facilitate trade between the monks and the outside world, with the two connected by a long, winding trail known as the [Pilgrim's Path](https://pathfinderwiki.com/w/index.php?title=Pilgrim%27s_Path&action=edit&redlink=1 "Pilgrim's Path (page does not exist)").[2](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Willowshore#cite_note-season-of-ghosts-player-s-guide-7-2)[3](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Willowshore#cite_note-season-of-ghosts-player-s-guide-9-3) Zhi Hui died in [7054 IC](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/4554_AR "4554 AR"), and amid the town's transition to logging and discord among the Sangpotshi monks, the monastery was effectively abandoned by [7060 IC](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/4560_AR "4560 AR").[4](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Willowshore#cite_note-season-of-ghosts-player-s-guide-15-16-4)

In [7062 IC](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/4562_AR "4562 AR"), a group of loggers from [Sze](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sze "Sze") that included the son of Sze's leader [Chou Mingxia](https://pathfinderwiki.com/w/index.php?title=Chou_Mingxia&action=edit&redlink=1 "Chou Mingxia (page does not exist)")[5](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Willowshore#cite_note-the-summer-that-never-was-3-5) attempted to harvest ancient [sugi](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sugi "Sugi") trees at the monastery's site, but returned to town as hostile [undead](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Undead "Undead"). The townsfolk fended them off in a deadly battle later known as the **Night of Broken Blades**. The abandoned monastery was subsequently regarded as cursed and avoided,[4](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Willowshore#cite_note-season-of-ghosts-player-s-guide-15-16-4) though many of the town's residents remained faithful to Sangpotshi.[3](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Willowshore#cite_note-season-of-ghosts-player-s-guide-9-3)

Shenmen eventually deployed lumber lords to the village to support Imperial Lung Wa's need for lumber, and set about making infrastructural improvements to grow it into a town, including bridges and a dam. However, with new settlers came divisions of class, unwanted aristocratic tourists, and forced seizures of the town's sustenance.[4](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Willowshore#cite_note-season-of-ghosts-player-s-guide-15-16-4) Among its most renowned exports were its [fulus](https://pathfinderwiki.com/w/index.php?title=Fulu&action=edit&redlink=1 "Fulu (page does not exist)"), which were coveted by [adventurers](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer").[6](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Willowshore#cite_note-the-summer-that-never-was-83-6)
