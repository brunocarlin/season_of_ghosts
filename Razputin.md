## Description

Human, Young, Detective, Psychic

Razputin is a young boy, sporting his hand-made custom matching set of trench coat, boots and capris. Though supposedly human to his core, Razputin's eyes seem to glow orange in dim-light, and this color pallete spills into his outfit with orange highlights all over.

He is often self-serious, with a neutral to intense look on his face, usually with his hands in his pockets. In combat, his hands are removed from said pockets, often times needing them to guide his mental magic, or pressing fingers to temple to help bear the strain of greater psychic feats.
## Personal Quest

Find out what happened to his parents



## Backstory

Razputin was an orphan like any other for many years, having grown up in the Willowshore orphanage and knowing nothing else except the town and the people in it. As he reached puberty, Razputin's powers began to manifest. The heads of the orphanage grew tired of his pranks over time, and his growing friendship with Teders in later adolescence only increased the confusion and fear the adults had towards Razputin. At 14 he determined to leave the orphanage for good, thanking them for raising him and promising to stay out of trouble, he took to the streets of Willowshore. Nowadays he mostly just tries to find odd-jobs, and the town itself has become something of a second adopted family as it turns out it does indeed take a village to raise a child.

Still, so many strange looks Razputin has never been able to settle. He'll often catch the shadow of sadness, fear, or maybe pity flickering across the faces of adults when they think he can't see them, and in the pit of his stomach he knows they're remembering something of his past they're too much of a coward to share. Because alas, Razputin has never heard a single word of what truly happened to his parents, only that the village would care for him.

Something stinks to high heaven. These people know what happened to his parents but won't share, and he knows asking will get him nowhere. As his psychic powers grow, Razputin is putting on his Detective hat and going to get to the bottom of it some day.
