## Backstory

Siff is a 5 foot tall kitsune with a thin, gangly build, dark ashen fur and three fox tails that are tipped with ember colored tuffs, as are his ears. He's clad in a set of large, flowing, black robes with accents of red and is often seen with a large scarf and a dagger. Siff is not native to Willowshore having arrived here with Elizeth Candora, the head of the cathedral to Pharasma, and serves as an assistant, tending to the cathedral, its graves and such. Aside from the cathedral he often offers help where healing or death is involved, helping gather materials for the herbalist and assisting in tending to the other graves. The past isn't something he brings up willingly, giving brief answers if asked, as he's wanting to keep his past as a thief a secret, making him wary in nature as a result of this.
