¬†A simple tale of an Elven slave boy who lived underground. Born a slave and raised as one. So ingrained was the institution of slavery in this area of the Underdark. That he had no inclination or even the idea of anything else. His reality was that of Slave and Master. Nothing else even occurred to him to be possible. Bullied and maimed for being an Elf. To the point they cut off one ear and mangled the other. Humiliated and used for entertainment, he didn't hope for much, consigned to his role in the world.

  
  

¬†That was until he saw The Gentleman. A man of such contrasting personality and kindness, that he seemed in defiance of the very world itself. It was from observing this man that he learned of the concept of Freedom. And as far as he was concerned, this man was the embodiment of it. Only able to observe the man from afar, he learned as much as he could about the man. Their mannerisms, accent, charm, sense of style, penchant for gambling and skill with playing cards.

  
  

¬†Further still, this man, despite having empathy. Something others saw as weakness, something that was to be taken advantage of. He could fight, he could protect those he cared for. Then the The Gentleman freed the slaves. Wanting to thank him, finally able to talk to the man that defied the world. Just as he reached him, The Gentleman disappeared in a burst of playing cards. The crowd that surrounded him scrambled for the cards, after all the dust was settled, he was lucky enough to get a hold of a single card. The Four of Hearts

  
  

¬†Now freed and seeking purpose and a means to survive. He obsessively sought out the complete deck of cards. Starting out by doing his best to imitate The Gentleman, However he lacked the one thing that he felt he‚Äôd never have what The Gentleman did. Strength. The strength to support their beliefs and being able to not only defend oneself but others as well. Unfortunately it didn‚Äôt take long for him to resort to theft and swindling for most every card. Promising to himself that after he completed the deck, he truly begin his path on becoming like The Gentleman.  
  
  

¬†Decades passed before eventually sought out the final card. He had known where it was for some time, but it was in the hands of a Criminal Underlord. Who was once a slave as well, in fact they were both slaves to the same master for some years. Up until they were freed. This Underlord bragged that he had the most valuable and powerful card. The Ace of Spades. By the time he had collected all the other cards, he found that it was true, as it was the only one he hadn‚Äôt acquired yet.

  
  

¬†Too afraid to go for it yet he waited till it was the last one. Using their past ties to get close he found out something utterly devastating. He was told, everyone knew, they only ever saw The Gentleman use Fifty-Three cards. The original Fifty-Two and the Joker. So imagine his surprise when he found that he now held Two jokers. The Underlord lied. The Gentleman hid this. Searching everywhere, but after looking for the cards for so long, he noticed after a point that he could feel the cards. A sense that told him a card was near. Yet he could not feel the last one.

  
  

¬†That‚Äôs when he realized that The Gentleman kept the card. So he had a new purpose. Get to the surface. Not to seek out that man, but to go where they were from. Obtaining as many books and information about the surface as he could. After some time, the necessity and desire to go to the place that the Gentleman was said to have come from, was soon arriving. A whole new world that he could only imagine, as he only ever knew of the underground.

  

  
Somewhere where he wouldn't have to lie, steal and cheat just to survive. Having been run out of every place he ever settled down in for even the briefest of times. He had little choice but to do so. Eventually he made his way to the fabled world called the Surface. Only able to do so by burning every bridge, betraying, and swindling as many people as it took to get there. So much hate followed him, that when he finally managed to emerge onto the Surface.

  
  

¬†He was broken and poor, but he made it, to a world with an endless ceiling of a vast multitude of colors and light. The place where that man was from. Here he would change his ways. No longer would he have to steal, lie or hurt anyone ever again. In an unfamiliar land, He struggled to survive. Nearly dying to exposure, vicious beasts and monsters he thought were fairy tales in the books about the surface. The Surface was more challenging than expected.

  
  

¬†On the edge of death, exhausted and mentally beaten from his experiences in the Underdark. He gave up, nowhere was safe, the Surface of his dreams was nothing like what it actually was.¬† But if we know anything about him. Is that he fails. Stumbling aimlessly, by some sick twist of fate, he wandered into Willowshore. Surrounded by people who spoke in a language he didn't understand. Scared and bewildered. He threatened for them to stay away. Confusing them with those from the Underdark. Delirious from blood loss, dehydration and poison.¬†

  
  

¬†One approached with open hands, they were making motions. They were saying their name and it was clear that they were asking for his. But he didn't trust them, he was about to attack so they could finally give him what he wanted. Death. Yet he saw something in their collective eyes, all of them had an expression he had only seen once before. An expression of genuine concern. Like The Gentleman gave to those he protected and harmed to do so.

  
  

¬†With that thought in his head, for a brief moment, for the first time in over a hundred years. He felt safe. Relaxing and dropping his guard for only a moment but that's all it took for him to collapse from the exhaustion. Hallucinating, they were all now that man, and as he was passing out, he called out The Gentleman‚Äôs name: Dan‚Ä¶ Te.  
  

  

¬†Awakening to an unfamiliar ceiling, a warm bed, and sweet scents hanging in the air. Feeling rested and finding his wounds having been cleaned and tended to. The people of Willowshore saved him. Calling him Dan-Tei. This struck him by surprise at first. Only vaguely remembering what had transpired before he passed out. Though he took a great deal of pride that he was being called by that name now. Made him feel like his dream of becoming like The Gentleman was that much closer.  
  

  
Despite resolving to stop living by his old ways. Dan-Tei hid his ancestry from everyone. Even other elves. For he was instilled with the fear that they would hate or hurt him if they ever found out. Going to great lengths to keep up the appearance of a Human. It wasn't hard, given his one ear was mangled and the other was gone entirely. The people assumed as much, well before he even started hiding it. But still Dan-Tei kept up the misconception. Even going as far to ‚Äúgrow a beard‚Äù, because have you ever seen an Elf with a beard?

  

  
It didn't take long for Dan-Tei to learn the language of Willowshore, thanks to Mai-Lai teachings, and from there he began to help with more diplomatic matters. Doing his best to temper relations between the Northridgers and the Southbankers and most of all, between the people of Willowshore and the Lumber Lords. Working at the Cerulean Teahouse helped in this endeavor. Thanks to his charming demeanor, unique fancy attire and knack for gambling. Dan-Tei ingratiated himself to the Lumber Lords who often invited him into their manors.

  
  

¬†Unfortunately for all, Dan-Tei had a terrible habit of picking the pockets of the Lumber Lords and stealing from their houses. A combination of this and some terrible deceptions deployed by Dan-Tei. The Lumber Lords stopped coming to the Cerulean Teahouse, accusing the hostess and her staff of stealing, but never able to prove it.  
  

  
Dan-Tei managed to dissuade them from catching any of the blame himself through his standard false flattery and connections he had built up with them. Eventually managing to deceive them into believing that the Cerulean Teahouse had nothing to do with the thefts but it was too late. The novelty had long since faded and that was only a trigger to their falling out of interest entirely.

  
  

¬†This would only be the start of Dan-Tei‚Äôs spiral of failures. Crestfallen Dan-Tei tried to make things better for Mai-Lai, whom he had felt indebted to, for having given him a real job, and teaching him more than just the language but how to trust people. Not to mention he had fallen in love with Mai-Lai, not just for what she had done for him but for her perseverance, acumen for business, and her generous but stern nature.  
  

  
Using the money he gained from the Labor Lords to help with all her future business venture‚Äôs. However, Dan-Tei made a mistake in the ordering of supplies, he also failed to account for the time it would take to deliver perishable goods to Willowshore, and he had nearly ruined the deal that Mai-Lai had worked so hard to make with the Leshy salon. Mountain Summit Grass.

  
  

¬†Which was the last straw for Mai-Lai, kicking Dan-Tei out of her life and business. Heartbroken and desperate, Dan-Tei blamed the Lumber Lords for all his problems. So as a final attempt to win back Mai-Lai. He ran a con with the Lumber Lords to take as much as they had, however this would prove to be his final mistake. Dan-Tei succeeded in taking what he wanted from them but he was too cocky and careless. He had Volunteered to be that year's Abductee as an alibi for the con. It didn‚Äôt work and the Labor Lords were on to him, So he ran before he could finish his role in the festival.

  
  

¬†Seeing Mai-Lai one last time before he left to proclaim he was leaving to get rid of the Lumber Lords from the source. By dealing with the Lung Wa Empire. Dan-Tei even offered the wealth he had stolen from the Lumber Lords as proof of his love for her, but Mai-Lai rejected it and his love. Telling him to go and never come back. Throwing him out the front of the Cerulean Teahouse. Where he futilely exclaimed, to an audience of onlookers. Shouting at the closed and locked doors of the Teahouse ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it! I‚Äôll get those damned Lumber Lords out of Willowshore, then you‚Äôll see! Then You‚Äôll L-‚Äù Dan-Tei noticed the crowd before he could finish. Embarrassed and out of time to escape his crimes. He left Willowshore.  
  

  
It‚Äôs been thirteen years since Dan-Tei left the town he loved. In the time since he‚Äôs been gone, all he has done is get drunk and gamble away his fortune, going from one scheme to the next to keep himself alive. When he learned of the fall of the Lung Wa Empire, he could only laugh and lament. Yet he still had no desire to return to Willowshore, too ashamed and poor to even attempt such an endeavor. Consigning himself to his own self made Hell, in the city of Sze. However, if Dan-Tei is good at anything it‚Äôs failing to do what he wants.

  
  

¬†Running across one of the Lumber Lords from Willowshore, Dan-Tei found out that they never revealed that he had conned them out of so much of their fortunes to the people of Willowshore. Too embarrassed to have the common folk know they had been tricked by such a cad. Dan-Tei laughed at him which offended the man, who didn't seem to remember Dan-Tei, but they were offended all the same. Not knowing when to stop and still blaming the Lumber Lords for all his problems, he continued to taunt the man.¬†

  
  

¬†This forced him to flee for his life, as the man gathered all who hated Dan-Tei. Which wasn't hard, as Dan-Tei had made many enemies in Sze. Aristocrats, Merchants, Gangs, Crime Lords, and even other Conmen like him. All ran him out of the city. Where Dan-Tei found that there was nowhere he could go, due to the influence of all those who hated him had across the country. Wanted and out of funds and options, even incapable of leaving the country at this point. Dan-Tei fled to the only place that didn't have anyone who wanted him dead. Willowshore, or so he thought‚Ä¶

  
  
  

(A few things about the disguise. Dan-Tei‚Äôs only ear is something that could provide the best clue to inquiries about his true heritage to the other PCs. Something fun I thought of that you could use if any successfully seen past the disguise and passed an appropriate Identify check will notice something like this:  
‚Äúfor the most part he looks human, but subtle angles of his face and other features of his body suggest something is ever so slightly off. That‚Äôs when you remember that aside from the pointy outer ear, elves are so known for, you remember that they also have a pronounced inner flare. That in humans is normally rounded and short, but for elves it's wider and comes to a point as well.‚Äù

Another vague clue is that his pupils glow or shine in the semi or full darkness. Like those with Darkvision. Not the best clue but it's something. Also he's been in Willowshore for quite some time, having arrived some fifty years prior to leaving fifteen years ago. And he was already some 150 years old when he arrived. So he has not aged much or at all. Though Dan-Tei makes some effort to appear older upon his return at least by making the hair on his temples more gray or white. Even going as far to salt and pepper his ‚Äúbeard‚Äù.)
