## Backstory

Born to Lin He as Lin Hua, she was the youngest child of four siblings. Despite not having a father, she grew up quite happily with her siblings, mother and uncle. When she was 14, her eldest brother died in a hunting accident and the family was torn apart by grief because of it. Hua ended up leaving home due to this, along with her emergence of magic, and wound up sailing down the Gan-Tzou river with a group of merchants, and changing her name to Kuan Hua.

Within a few months of leaving, she found herself in the fortified port town of Karahai. While there she met a Priestess of Daikitsu, Hou ZhenYa, who recognised Hua's sorcerous ability and helped council her. She took Hua under her wing and brought her to her hometown of Willowshore. As an apprentice at the Nine-Ear shrine, she excelled and became far more confident in her magical ability as well as her Kitsune transformation. She even managed to overcome her grief, sending a message home to her elder sister and mother explaining that she was alive and well, and had found her calling in life. Her sister responded saying she was well and had started a family of her own, but their mother was not. Hua kept up sending twice yearly messages to her sister.

Two short years after she was apprenticed, Hua successfully succeeded her mentor as a Priestess of Daikitsu presiding over the Nine-Ear Shrine. Shortly after beginning her tenure, she manages to catch the eye of young farmer, Li Yong, and they start a discrete romance. By the time Hua was 20, and three years as a Priestess, she accepted Li Yong's marriage proposal and was welcomed into his family home, changing her name to KuanLi Hua, with the only the awkward moment being when she explained that she was a Kitsune to Yong's parents despite them being quite accepting.

Not long after she had her first child, Li Hao. She did a lot of juggling between being a priestess, a mother and a wife. While she felt she did a good job, there were some calls for her to find an apprentice to succeed her at the shrine. Something she tried to do after the birth of her twins, Li Xin and Li Jun, but had very little luck with. She did have to preside over the shrine when a baby was hidden there and a skulk of foxes appeared to protect the shrine and baby. KuanLi took care of the baby girl until a distant relative came to pick her up. Twelve years later, that child, Ouh BaMing, came back to the shrine and requested to be apprenticed.

When the Lung Wa Empire fell, KuanLi weathered the storms that preceded the fall and towards the end of the year, she felt her apprentice had learned enough to take over the shrine and allowed her to take her postition of Priestess, leaving KuanLi to focus more on her family, as two of her teenage children (Hao and Jun) have begun to show signs of being Kitsune. She has been guiding them through this and helping them come to terms with it, while not leaving her other child, Xun, out of it.

During the winter of 7107, KuanLi received a visitor in the form of her estranged mother Lin He. She came bearing all the letters that KuanLi had sent to her, had an in-depth discussion and apology for her failings towards KuanLi and her siblings, and has said that she wants to make things right with her. KuanLi took a few weeks but ultimately decided to forgive her mother, and with the support of her husband, she invited her mother to stay with her.

When the monsters attacked after the Reenactment Festival of 7108, she took her family to the safety of the Matsuki estate and helped provide first aid and healing efforts for the other townsfolk that sheltered there as well. After this she has decided to step up and help protect the town from the misfortune that has befallen it
