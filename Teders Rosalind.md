## Backstory

Teders Rosalind is a small poppet. With a lack of any real defining features across their stitching besides a large red stain across their head and chest, Teders became sort of a town set piece. Wandering around without any real aim or objective. The only interaction they share with most is a simple easing of tensions or pain via a healing spell or calming word. They've being sighted around school yards with young children. Healing and trying to help them accomplish those via aid. These visits are usually shunned by the children's parents due to Teders off-settling appearance, considering them an ill omen left behind from the many ghost towns.

I was going for more of a situation where a small girl had owned teders when they was a normal poppet, but she somehow died while holding them. Giving them that red mark near their face and chest and letting that bloodstain act as their bloodline to sorcery.  If you've ever watched the movie "9" it'll be a similar thing where someone dies and their soul kind of sparks a object with life. Leaving the object to wander around for the most part.
hadn't decided anything specific, so it could probably be some cabin in the woods type deal
